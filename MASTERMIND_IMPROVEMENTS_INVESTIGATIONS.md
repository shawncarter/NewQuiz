---

## üöÄ Immediate Improvement Opportunities

### 1. **Security Fixes**

**Critical**: Fix answer exposure vulnerability
```python
# Current (INSECURE):
'all_questions': pre_loaded_questions,  # Contains answers

# Improved:
'questions': [
    {
        'question_id': q['question_id'],
        'question_text': q['question_text'], 
        'choices': q['choices'],
        # DON'T send correct_answer to client
    } for q in pre_loaded_questions
]
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Server-side answer validation only
- Client sends question_id + selected_choice
- Server validates against cached correct answers

### 2. **State Management Improvements**

**Replace cache-only state with hybrid approach**:

```python
# New MastermindRound model
class MastermindRound(models.Model):
    game_session = models.ForeignKey(GameSession, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    round_number = models.IntegerField()
    state = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='waiting_for_player_selection')
    current_player = models.ForeignKey(Player, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    completed_players = models.JSONField(default=list)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

# Cache only for performance, not as source of truth
```

**Benefits**:
- Database persistence prevents data loss
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Better support for game resumption
- Audit trail of state changes

### 3. **Simplified WebSocket Architecture**

**Consolidate message types**:
```python
# Instead of: 6+ mastermind-specific message types
# Use: Generic mastermind action pattern

{
    'type': 'mastermind_action',
    'action': 'select_player',  # or 'ready_response', 'continue'
    'data': { ... }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Fewer message handlers
- Consistent message structure
- Easier to extend with new actions

### 4. **Question Management Refactoring**

**Create proper taxonomy**:
```python
class Subject(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

class SpecialistQuestion(models.Model):
    subject = models.ForeignKey(Subject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    question_text = models.TextField()
    choices = models.JSONField()
    correct_answer = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    difficulty = models.CharField(max_length=20, default='medium')
    last_used = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    usage_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
```

**Benefits**:
- Better question organization
- Efficient queries with foreign keys
- Support for difficulty levels
- Better analytics and reporting

    @abstractmethod
    def get_round_handler(self, game_session, round_number):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_websocket_handlers(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod  
    def get_templates(self):
        pass

# Mastermind as plugin
class MastermindPlugin(GameModePlugin):
    def get_round_handler(self, game_session, round_number):
        return MastermindGameController(game_session, round_number)
```

**Investigation Areas**:
- Django plugin architecture patterns
- Dynamic template loading
- WebSocket handler registration
- Database model registration
- Plugin discovery and configuration

### 6. **State Machine Implementation**

**Formalize mastermind states with proper state machine**:

```python
from django_fsm import FSMField, transition

class MastermindRound(models.Model):
    state = FSMField(default='waiting_for_player_selection')
    
    @transition(field=state, source='waiting_for_player_selection', target='asking_ready')
    def select_player(self, player):
        self.current_player = player
        
    @transition(field=state, source='asking_ready', target='playing')
    def start_rapid_fire(self):
        # Pre-load questions, start timer
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents invalid state transitions
- Clear state transition documentation  
- Better error handling
- State change auditing

### 7. **Microservice Architecture Investigation**

**Research extracting mastermind as separate service**:

```yaml
# Docker composition
services:
  quiz-core:
    build: ./core
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
  
  mastermind-service:
    build: ./mastermind
    ports: ["8001:8001"]
    environment:
      CORE_SERVICE_URL: http://quiz-core:8000
```

**Areas to investigate**:
- Service communication patterns (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC)
- Data consistency between services
- WebSocket handling across services
- Deployment complexity
- Performance implications
