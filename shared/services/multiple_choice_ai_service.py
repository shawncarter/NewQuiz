Focus on:
- Football (soccer), Rugby, Cricket, Tennis
- British athletes, teams, venues  
- Premier League, Wimbledon, Six Nations, The Ashes
- Avoid American sports (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)

AVOID typical questions like:
- "Who won Wimbledon in 2013?" (too common)
- "Which team won the most Premier League titles?" (overused)

Instead focus on:
- Lesser-known historical facts
- Specific records or achievements  
- Unusual rules or trivia
- Stadium names, kit colors, nicknames
- Memorable moments beyond the obvious

Requirements:
- Return ONLY valid JSON format
- 4 answer choices exactly
- Make it challenging but fair
- Avoid the most obvious/googled questions

Format:
{{
    "question": "Your question here?",
    "choices": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],

- "Who plays Tony Stark?" (Robert Downey Jr)
- "What is the chemical symbol for gold?" (Au)
- "What is the capital of France?" (Paris)
- "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?" (Shakespeare)

Instead create questions about:
- Lesser-known facts within the subject
- Specific technical details
- Historical context beyond the famous events
- Connections between concepts
- Unusual or surprising information
- Deeper knowledge that's still accessible

Requirements:
- Return ONLY valid JSON format
- 4 answer choices exactly
- Make it moderately challenging but avoid the most common trivia
- Focus on interesting, less obvious aspects of {category}
- Ensure the question would make someone think "I didn't know that!"

- Avoid the most obvious questions that anyone might know
- Questions should be suitable for someone who considers this their specialist subject

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Each object must have:
